- Open the project in your code editor.

## Tasks

1) __Display the currently selected city.__ You'll need to:
  - Create a new React component called `Display`
  - Render that component into `#display`
  - Make the component read its state from `SelectedValueStore`
  - Make the component listen for changes from `SelectedValueStore`

2) __Display the number of times a selection has been made.__ You'll need to:
  - Add a new store for this value, `SelectionCountStore`
  - Make the store listen for `VALUE_WAS_SELECTED` in the dispatcher
  - Use those events to update the store's value and update subscribers
  - Display that value in your new component
